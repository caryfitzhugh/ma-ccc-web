                    <p>Warmer weather and changes in the lengths of seasons could alter the composition of various natural habitats, reducing habitat quality for native species and allowing invasive species and pests to gain entry. Warming and other changes in the seasons may also change the timing of natural processes such as migration, reproduction, and flowering, potentially disrupting the symbiotic connection between animals and their food sources and between plants and pollinators.</p>
                    <p>Rising temperatures will warm Massachusetts fresh and saltwater areas, increasing habitat for some fish species, while degrading it for others. Certain populations of cold water fish and shellfish like cod stocks may experience sharp declines, and warmer fish species may migrate into the area. Algal blooms may become more frequent as lakes and ponds get warmer, and harmful algae types like cyanobacteria may become more common, creating risks for swimmers and water supplies.</p>

                 <p>Wetter winters and springs expected in Massachusetts and drier summers may stress important habitats and species. Changes in soil moisture, for example, could alter species composition. Increasingly large precipitation events may cause flood flows and erosion in streams and rivers, with impacts on aquatic and riparian species and habitats. Flooding of riparian areas and wetlands could export dissolved organic matter and soils, and carry more pollutants to downstream to lakes and ponds and coastal waters. </p>

                <p>An increased frequency and intensity of extreme storms will have wide ranging effects on natural resources and habitats in Massachusetts. These storms could cause ecosystem scale disturbances (like tree blow downs) that often allow invasive species to move into these disturbed ecosystems. Extreme weather is also likely to cause more flooding and erosion that will affect many habitats.  Stronger downpours that increase runoff could carry pathogens and pollutants from farm fields, roads, and other impervious surfaces into surface waters, degrading water quality for aquatic species and drinking water supplies. </p>

                  <p>Rising sea levels in the Commonwealth are likely to cause hydrologic changes to ecosystems like salt marshes, which may alter their plant species composition and overall health, size, and location. Some marshes may deteriorate completely or be inundated by rising seas. Where there are places for existing salt marshes to migrate inland, they may survive, but many may not. At the same time, rising seas may cause breaches in barrier islands and the creation of new inlets, prompting new marshes to form. Many other kinds of habitats â€“ from coastal dunes to estuarine inlets - may be affected by increased erosion from the combined effects of sea level rise and coastal storm surges. </p>
                  <p>Permanent seawater inundation will also permanently alter freshwater ecosystems like wetlands.</p>

          <p> The diverse natural resources and habitats across the Commonwealthâ€”from hardwood forests to coastal salt marches, valley floodplains to freshwater trout streamsâ€”are an essential part of what makes our state such a great place to live. They also are critical assets in our efforts to combat and prepare for climate change.</p>
          <p> Forests, wetlands, and other naturally vegetated landscapes are estimated to sequester approximately 10 percent of the Commonwealthâ€™s carbon emissions. They also provide a wide array of ecosystem services for our communities, including buffering developed areas against flood damage, providing shade and cooling during very hot days, and supporting diverse species of wildlife. </p>
          <p> These ecosystems and the species they support will experience many impacts from a changing climate. Some of the impacts may include shrinkage and loss of critical habitats, shifts in habitat range for native species, alterations to the timing of natural processes like migration, reproduction, and flowering; declines in the diversity and abundance of wildlife populations; and increased populations of invasive species, pests, and weeds. </p>
          <p> By protecting these ecosystems and managing them wisely, we can increase the chances that they will remain resilient as the climate changes. Healthy intact forests, for example, will be much better able to withstand stresses ranging from extreme storms to new forest pests. If we support the long-term health and resilience of the Commonwealthâ€™s ecosystems, we will be helping ourselves, too. Protecting natural areas is one of the least costly and most effective approaches to preparing for climate impacts like riverine flooding and coastal storm surge.</p>
