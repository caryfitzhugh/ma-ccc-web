                  <p>Higher average temperatures in Massachusetts coupled with increases in ozone and particulate matter production could result in poor air quality and health impacts for populations with existing respiratory diseases. Warming could also result in an increase in plant pollen production and more allergenic pollen content, which may exacerbate allergies, asthma and other respiratory illnesses.</p>
                  <p>There may also be an increase in the incidence of vector-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, and West Nile virus, etc., as ticks and mosquitoes are able to overwinter further North and become more prevalent. During extreme heat, industrial accidents, chemical releases and explosions could occur if temperature thresholds for safe storage are surpassed.</p>

Extensive and damaging flooding events and their aftermath could increase the potential for water-borne disease outbreaks. Greater volumes of stormwater and agricultural runoff could transport sediments, pathogens, nutrients, and pesticides to nearby waterways and create risks for swimming, fishing, or drinking water quality. </p>

          <p>Massachusettsâ€™ advanced health care system will face new challenges as climate change impacts the health and welfare of residents across the Commonwealth. Climate change will affect residents both directly via extreme heat events and severe storms and indirectly through increases in vector-borne diseases and increased allergens. Social factors such as economic status, access to resources, health, age, or geography make some Massachusetts residents more vulnerable to these impacts.</p>

          <p>To support and promote a strong, healthy, and resilient population and develop responsive local health systems, we need to use a variety of approaches that build on conventional and existing medical and public health standards. These approaches may include using health surveillance systems to track disease occurrence and identifying locations and population groups at greatest risk for specific health threats. Strategies may also include assessing infrastructure capacity and emergency response preparedness, and developing preparedness and response plans.</p>

          <p>Many greenhouse gas reduction measures will improve public health and welfare. Clean energy strategies that replace polluting fossil fuel energy with wind, hydroelectric, or solar energy or encourage more active, non-motorized transportation will have significant air quality benefits. Encouraging walking, biking and use of public transit also can have significant benefits for public health. But care should be taken to ensure that new strategies for meeting greenhouse gas reduction targets do not adversely affect public health in unexpected ways.</p>

          <p>Effective adaptation strategies to prepare for climate change will reduce public health risks, while increasing resilience. These strategies range from large-scale regional initiatives to delivery of personalized health services for individuals at risk, and include: <Footnote num='1'/> </p>
