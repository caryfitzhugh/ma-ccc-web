        <p> Governments have a special responsibility to keep people safe by reducing risks from disasters and being at-the-ready to respond when emergencies do occur.</p>

        <p>Emergency management is the work that governments do to coordinate and integrate activities and investments needed to mitigate against, prepare for, respond to, and recover from threatened or actual natural disasters, acts of terrorism, or other man-made disasters.</p>

        <p>Emergency management that is proactive, responsive, and efficient will become critically important as the Commonwealthâ€™s climate changes, because natural disasters and emergencies are likely to become more frequent.  Under Governor Bakerâ€™s Executive Order 569 on Climate Change, Massachusettsâ€™ is developing the nationâ€™s first-ever integrated <em>State Hazard Mitigation and Climate Adaptation Plan</em></p>
